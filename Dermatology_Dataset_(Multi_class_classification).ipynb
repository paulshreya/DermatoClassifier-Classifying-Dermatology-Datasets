        "\n",
        "*There are various machine learning models that can be used for multiclass classification tasks. Here are some popular ones:*\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Logistic Regression:** Despite its name, logistic regression is commonly used for binary classification. However, it can be extended to handle multiclass classification using techniques like one-vs-rest (OvR) or softmax regression.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Decision Trees:** Decision trees can naturally handle multiclass classification problems. They partition the feature space into regions, with each region corresponding to a different class.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Random Forest:** Random Forest is an ensemble learning method that builds multiple decision trees and combines their predictions. It can handle multiclass classification tasks effectively and is robust to overfitting.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM):** Gradient Boosting algorithms like XGBoost, LightGBM, and CatBoost can be used for multiclass classification. They build an ensemble of weak learners (typically decision trees) sequentially to improve predictive accuracy.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Support Vector Machines (SVM):** SVMs can be used for multiclass classification by employing strategies like one-vs-one or one-vs-rest. SVMs aim to find the optimal hyperplane that separates the classes in the feature space.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Neural Networks:** Deep learning models, particularly neural networks, have gained popularity for multiclass classification tasks. Architectures like feedforward neural networks, convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) can be used depending on the nature of the data.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN):** KNN is a simple and intuitive algorithm for multiclass classification. It classifies instances based on the majority class among their nearest neighbors in the feature space.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Naive Bayes:** Naive Bayes classifiers are probabilistic models that assume independence among features. Despite their simplicity, they can perform well on certain types of multiclass classification problems, especially when the independence assumption holds.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Ensemble Methods:** Besides Random Forest and Gradient Boosting, other ensemble methods like AdaBoost and Bagging can also be used for multiclass classification. They combine multiple base classifiers to improve overall performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "These are some of the common machine learning models used for multiclass classification tasks. The choice of the model depends on various factors such as the nature of the data, the size of the dataset, computational resources, and the specific requirements of the problem. It's often beneficial to experiment with multiple models and techniques to find the one that performs best for a particular task."

        "The intuition behind the k-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithm is to make predictions based on the similarity of data points. It assumes that similar data points tend to have similar target values. So, when presented with a new data point, KNN looks at the k nearest data points (neighbors) in the feature space and predicts the target value based on the majority class (for classification) or the average value (for regression) among those neighbors.\n",

        "- K-Nearest Neighbour is one of the simplest Machine Learning algorithms based on Supervised Learning technique.\n",
        "- K-NN algorithm assumes the similarity between the new case/data and available cases and put the new case into the category that is most similar to the available categories.\n",
        "- K-NN algorithm stores all the available data and classifies a new data point based on the similarity. This means when new data appears then it can be easily classified into a well suite category by using K- NN algorithm.\n",
        "- K-NN algorithm can be used for Regression as well as for Classification but mostly it is used for the Classification problems.\n",
        "- K-NN is a non-parametric algorithm, which means it does not make any assumption on underlying data.\n",
        "- It is also called a lazy learner algorithm because it does not learn from the training set immediately instead it stores the dataset and at the time of classification, it performs an action on the dataset.\n",
